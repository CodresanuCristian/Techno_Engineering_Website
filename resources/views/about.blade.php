                            <p>Techno Engineering & Associates was founded in July 2004 by two highly experienced and accomplished civil engineers, contract and claims experts, Eng. Eugenia Dunca and Eng. Giovanni Di Folco. They had observed that many contractors with good merits in defence of the poor status of their projects, were suffering losses with little or no means of recovery available to them. 
                            This prompted them to consider setting up the firm, which had been their vision for some time. After researching the Romanian and Eastern European construction industry, they assessed that with relevance to the Romanian market, there was a dearth of specialized consulting services to support contracting parties’ interests. The first clientele were acquaintances of the owners and the early successes of TE&A soon earned the firm a prestigious reputation which soon developed into the niche market whereby the firm was in a position to expand to provide the visionary one-stop-shop approach, by having developed its own legal, contracts, planning and quantum departments, which has proven to be the keystone of its success.
